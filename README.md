## Who I Am

I am a security-first engineer with 10+ years of experience across:
- Blockchain architecture
- High-performance backend systems
- Distributed infrastructure
- Offensive security & pentesting

I build systems where **security, correctness and scalability** are non-negotiable.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Security by design
- Protocol-first thinking
- Avoid overengineering
- Ship. Measure. Refine.
